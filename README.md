# Cab-Fare-Compare

Cab Fare Compare emerges as a solution to streamline this process and empower users with the ability to make informed decisions when booking rides. By aggregating fare data from various ride-hailing platforms into a single platform, Cab Fare Compare simplifies the comparison process, enabling users to easily compare fares and select the most beneficial option directly from the site itself.

## Data Preprocessing
In data preprocessing for Cab Fare Compare, null entries were removed to ensure dataset integrity, followed by feature scaling to standardize numerical features, enhancing the accuracy of fare comparison results.

## Dataset
[Click here to download Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wB5_8y7mKhS4zgAhriuwZ4DqyGOZK0hN/view?usp=sharing) Contains data of 154235 customers and contains 16 variables.

## Feature Engineering
In this phase, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to effectively reduce dimensionality and extract essential features from the dataset. By condensing the original features into a smaller set of principal components, PCA facilitated a more efficient representation of the data while retaining its key characteristics.

 __Visualization__:

Various graphs and visualizations were generated to gain insights into the clustering results and interpret customer segments effectively. Visualization techniques played a crucial role in understanding the distribution of data points across clusters and assessing the coherence of the identified segments.
